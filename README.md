This is a simple React-based note-taking application. The app allows users to create, display, and delete notes dynamically.

Features:
Add Notes: Users can add new notes with a title and content. The addNote function updates the state to include the new note without overwriting existing ones.

Delete Notes: Users can delete specific notes. The deleteNote function filters out the note with the corresponding id from the state.

Dynamic Rendering: Notes are dynamically displayed using the map function, which renders a <Note /> component for each note in the notes array.

Component-Based Architecture: The app is built with reusable components like Header, Footer, CreateArea, and Note.
